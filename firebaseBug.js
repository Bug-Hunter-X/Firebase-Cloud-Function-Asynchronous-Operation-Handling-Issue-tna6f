The issue stems from an asynchronous operation within a Firebase function that isn't properly handled, leading to unexpected behavior.  Specifically, the `onWrite` function doesn't wait for the asynchronous database operation to complete before returning. This results in the function exiting prematurely, and the database update might not be fully reflected before other parts of the application attempt to read the updated data. This often leads to stale data or race conditions.
