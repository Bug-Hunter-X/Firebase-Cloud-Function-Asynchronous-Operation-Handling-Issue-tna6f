# Firebase Cloud Function Asynchronous Operation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Cloud Functions where asynchronous operations within an `onWrite` trigger are not properly handled.  The bug leads to inconsistent data and race conditions due to the function returning before asynchronous tasks are complete.  The solution showcases how to correctly handle such scenarios using Promises or async/await.

## Bug Description

The provided `firebaseBug.js` file contains a Firebase Cloud Function that updates a document in Firestore. However, it does not properly handle the asynchronous nature of the Firestore update operation, resulting in the function returning before the update is fully committed. This can lead to other parts of the application reading outdated data. 

## Solution

The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to manage this asynchronous operation using async/await, ensuring that the function awaits the completion of the Firestore update before returning. This guarantees data consistency.
